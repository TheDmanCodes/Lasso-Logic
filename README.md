We have created code for line following and picking up objects.

The picking-up object code accuracy is pretty good, it works 3 out of 4 times, We could improve it by incrementing the line running into it.

The Line running code is working well, it follows the line smoothly and rarely breaks. We could make it better by canceling out the excess light so that the reading is better and also make it able to line-follow in sharp turns.

We still have work to do but we are doing well, and are close to perfecting the line follow and pick up object code.
